# Project II: Extending the Ray Tracer
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2019

## Purpose

This project extends the ray tracer developed in Homework 5. It implements some of the ray tracing topics we have covered, namely:

- ray casting
- brdf's
- anti-aliasing
- light sources
- acceleration structures

## Background

For this homework, you must

- have a working solution to Homework 5
- know how to read and write object oriented code in C++
- understand the concepts listed above
- know how to compile a c++ project spanning multiple files in multiple directories
- know vector arithmetic

## The Problem Set

The problems are defined in `main.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

## Time Requirement.

Data unavailable.

## Grading

The marks for this assignment are shown in `rubric.csv`.

## Submission

There are 2 parts to the submission.

### 1 Problem Set

Submit _all_ code files in the `raytracer` folder. `World.cpp` should include the relevant file from the `build` folder corresponding to the high-res version of your showcase scene. Other `World::build` implementations (e.g. for the low-res version, or used to generate other pictures on your web page) should be included in the `build` folder. Compiling and running `raytracer.cpp` in the `raytracer` folder should generate the low-res image.

Include a `website` folder that includes your website, either as HTML, markdown, or a URL. The submitted web page must be complete, i.e. all required assets are submitted and no links are broken.

_Deadline_: 18h on Wednesday, 18 December

### 2 Feedback Form

You have to provide feedback on your team and on the project by filling the form at [LMS -> Tests & Quizzes](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/WwHsDI). This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

_Deadline_: 18h on Wednesday, 18 December

## Samples

Sample submissions or the project showcase can be found at [LMS -> Resources](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/QxeYNd).

## Bonus

The engine can be extended _ad infinitum_. Below are some recommendations but these need not limit you.

- adding interesting materials
- adding texturing
- adding optical effects
- adding a variety of acceleration structures
- implementing parallelization
- adding bump or normal mapping
- adding sophisticated ray tracers

## Tips

- Do not include identifying information in your submission.
- Only include images which you are comfortable sharing publicly.
- There is no late submission. Submit whatever you have by the deadline.
- Failure to turn in any of the above submissions will result in a withholding of marks for the homework.
- viel Spa√ü!

## Discussion
